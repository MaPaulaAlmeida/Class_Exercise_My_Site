      <b> &#128075; Hello, my name is María Paula B. Almeida...</b>
    </h1>
    <p>
      I was born of the city of Quito, the capital of Ecuador, on January 9,
      2006. I am currently 18 years old. This year has brought many changes for
      me, the biggest being my decision to move abroad and start college. I'm
      now living and studying in Porto, Portugal, an unforgettable experience at
      my young age.

        I have a strong passion for visual arts, which is why I chose to pursue a
        degree in <i>Audiovisual Communication and Multimedia</i>.In my free
        time, I enjoy watching movies, drawing, taking photos and listening to
        music. Traveling is also a big part of my life, allowing me to explore new
        cultures and places. Some of my favorite cities in the world are:

    In terms of my outlook on life, I deeply appreciate moments of peace and
    tranquility. At the same time, I'm driven by the excitement of working on
    large-scale projects that aim to make a positive social impact. This
    balance between calm and ambition keeps me focused and inspires me <u>to step out of my comfort zone</u> 
    to develop the best version of myself.
